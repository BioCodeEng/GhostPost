[R2] Djangoproject: QuerySet API reference <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/models/querysets/#order-by> (helpful in expanding on the ".objects.all()" and "order_by " functions that was very helpful in the views.py in this one)

[R4] Djangoproject.com: Form fields <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/forms/fields/> (Helpful for expanding my knowledge on forms and the choice fields for this assessemnt as well)

[R5] Django 3.1 documentation: Form fields <https://django.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ref/forms/fields.html#django.forms.IntegerField> (Another resources on Django and form fields to get an idea of how to handle choice fields and integer fields for the choice and voting parts of the assessment)
